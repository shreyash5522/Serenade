        <h1>My First Love</h1>
    </header>

    <main>
        <p><em>My first love... it wasnâ€™t just a feeling. It was everything I never knew my heart could hold. It was the first time I felt my heartbeat race not from fear, but from the pure rush of something beautiful. It was the first time my thoughts got tangled in someone else's, the first time my world seemed to stop just to listen to someone elseâ€™s voice.</em></p>

        <h2>It wasnâ€™t perfect, but it didnâ€™t need to be.</h2>
        <p>It was real, raw, and unfiltered. Every glance was a spark, every word a treasure. The way you looked at me made me believe the world could be ours, even if just for a fleeting moment. We didnâ€™t need promises, we didnâ€™t need forever. We had the magic of now, and it was everything.</p>

        <h2>The little things that mattered.</h2>
        <p>There was something about the way we laughed togetherâ€”it wasnâ€™t just joy; it was a connection, like we shared a secret the world didnâ€™t know. In that laughter, I found peace, a kind of peace I had never known before. And the silence between usâ€”it wasnâ€™t awkward, it was comfortable, like we didnâ€™t need to speak to understand each other.</p>

        <h2>The end of a chapter.</h2>
        <p>But first love is also fragile. Itâ€™s not built to last forever. Itâ€™s built to teach us something, to show us that love can be intense, but also transient. That sometimes, itâ€™s about the feeling more than the outcome.</p>

        <h2>Letting go... but not really letting go.</h2>
        <p>We drifted, as I knew we would. Not in anger, not in sorrow, but in a quiet realization that we were both still young, and the world was waiting for us. Letting go wasnâ€™t the end, thoughâ€”it was the beginning of a different kind of love, one that lives in memory, one that stays with you, quietly reminding you of that first rush, that first spark.</p>

        <h2>Years later...</h2>
        <p>Now, when I think of you, itâ€™s not with longing. Itâ€™s with a smile. Because I know that first loveâ€”no matter how briefâ€”shapes you. It teaches you how to feel deeply, how to love without limits, and how to carry those feelings with you, even after theyâ€™ve passed.</p>

        <p><em>First love is something you never truly forget. Not because it was perfect, but because it was yours. It was the first time your heart felt everything so intensely, and it will stay with you forever. It lives in the quietest moments, in the things you never say, and in the smile that crosses your face when you remember it.</em></p>
